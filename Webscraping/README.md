# Web-scraping NHS Trust Postcodes project

This is a personal project of mine to scrape the postcode of every NHS Trust listed on the
following page: https://www.nhs.uk/servicedirectories/pages/nhstrustlisting.aspx
This involved looping through this list, assembling a list of every link, looping through
every link and then pulling each trust's postcode, then adding each postcode to a map.

To run these files, first execute Link Collection, then Postcode Collection, and finally Map Creation.

These files have been kept separate in order to reduce the number of calls to the NHS' servers.

'uk.html' is a completed example html file.
